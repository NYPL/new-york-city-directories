#New York City Directories

The files in this repository are derived from the [New York City Directories](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/new-york-city-directories#/?tab=about) held by the New York Public Library collections.

## More fun with Public Domain materials

The images and the data that allowed me to pull down these volumes from The New York Public Library's Digital Collections are all contained in the [Public Domain release](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/) NYPL put out in January 2016. (disclosure: I co-led that project as an NYPL staffer, and remain very proud of it!) If you want to play with the data and utilities yourself, there's a great [NYPL Public Domain Github repo](https://github.com/NYPL-publicdomain/data-and-utilities) waiting for you.

## License
All materials in this collection are in the public domain according to rights analysis by the NYPL Copyright and Information Policy group. As a result, all the data and PDFs in this repo are likewise in the public domain. A CC0 license has been applied to this repo -- in the off chance that someone believes new copyright could attach to these images or the files, they are hereby released CC0 (even though they don't need to be by virtue of being public domain in the first place).
